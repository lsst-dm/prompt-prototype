``prompt_prototype`` is a package in the `LSST Science Pipelines <https://pipelines.lsst.io>`_.

``prompt_prototype`` contains code used for testing concepts for the Rubin Observatory Prompt Processing framework.
The design for the framework is described in `DMTN-219`_.

.. _DMTN-219: https://dmtn-219.lsst.io/

At present, the package does not conform exactly to the layout or conventions of LSST stack packages.
In particular, the Python code does not use the ``lsst`` namespace.
