class PipelinesConfig:
    """A pipeline configuration for the Prompt Processing service.

    This class provides the execution framework with a simple interface for
    identifying the pipeline to execute. It attempts to abstract the details of
    which factors affect the choice of pipeline to make it easier to add new
    features in the future.

    Notes
    -----
    While it is not expected that there will ever be more than one
    PipelinesConfig instance in a program's lifetime, this class is *not* a
    singleton and objects must be passed explicitly to the code that
    needs them.
