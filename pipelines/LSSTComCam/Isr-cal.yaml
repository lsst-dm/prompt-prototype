description: >-
  ISR-only pipeline specialized for LSSTComCam. This pipeline can be run on raw
  calibration data such as biases, and does not require a known filter.
  Its outputs are also kept separate from science visits.

      doFlat: false
      # TODO: need to turn off fringe support after DM-47959
